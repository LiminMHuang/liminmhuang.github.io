    "text": "Behavioural Economics Perspective\nFrom a behavioural economics perspective, the Monty Hall problem highlights several cognitive biases that influence decision-making. One such bias is the illusion of control, where people tend to overestimate their ability to control or influence outcomes [Langer, 1975]. In this case, contestants may feel that their initial choice is more likely to be correct, even though the probability has not changed. Another relevant bias is the sunk cost fallacy, where people are reluctant to abandon a choice they’ve already made, even if switching would be advantageous [Arkes and Blumer, 1985]."

    "text": "Bayesian Statistics Perspective\nInterestingly, the Monty Hall problem can be elegantly explained using Bayesian statistics. Bayes’ theorem is a mathematical formula that describes how to update probabilities based on new evidence [Bayes and Price, 1763]. In the context of the Monty Hall problem, let us define three events:\n\n\\(A\\): The car is behind Door 1\n\\(B\\): The car is behind Door 2\n\\(C\\): Host opens Door 3\n\nUsing Bayes’ theorem, we can calculate the probability of the car being behind Door 2, given that the host opened Door 3:\n\\[\nP(B \\mid C) = \\frac{P(C \\mid B) \\cdot P(B)}{P(C)}\n\\label{eq:bayes}\n\\]\nWe know that:\n\\[\nP(B) = \\frac{1}{3} \\quad \\text{(initial probability of car being behind Door 2)}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(C \\mid B) = 1 \\quad \\text{(the host must open Door 3 if the car is behind Door 2)}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(C) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\quad \\text{(probability of host opening Door 3)}\n\\]\nTo clarify the calculation of \\(P(C)\\), let us consider all possible scenarios where the host opens Door 3:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(\\text{Car@1 and Host opens 3}) &= P(\\text{Car@1}) \\times P(\\text{Host opens 3} \\mid \\text{Car@1}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{6} \\\\\nP(\\text{Car@2 and Host opens 3}) &= P(\\text{Car@2}) \\times P(\\text{Host opens 3} \\mid \\text{Car@2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3} \\\\\nP(\\text{Car@3 and Host opens 3}) &= P(\\text{Car@3}) \\times P(\\text{Host opens 3} \\mid \\text{Car@3}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 0 = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSumming these probabilities:\n\\[\nP(C) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{3} + 0 = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\nPlugging the values into Equation \\(\\ref{eq:bayes}\\):\n\\[\nP(B \\mid C) = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\nThis calculation confirms that switching doors yields a \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) probability of winning [Gill, 2002]."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe Monty Hall problem offers valuable insights for behavioural economists. It demonstrates how our intuitive judgments can lead us astray and highlights the importance of rigorous statistical thinking in decision-making [Kahneman and Tversky, 1979]. By understanding the cognitive biases at play and applying tools like Bayes’ theorem, we can make more informed and rational choices."
